I could have actually forked it but I didn't. My reasoning was that it wasn't going to be ITG3 anymore but it was being turned into ITG3Encore (something else while starting off using the same code).

What has been fixed so far:

* All **cmd()** transformed to **function(self)**
* Removed **D-Pad** Modifier since it breaks other Modifiers (like the new SpeedMod)
* Better and sorted **ScreenPlayerOptions**
* Added **MOD** & **BPM range** within **Name Badges** inside **ScreenPlayerOptions**
* Better **StatsDisplay/ShowStats** going from a range of 1-6 instead of just 3
  * Added option for a fully functional IIDX pacemaker with selectable target meter
    * For 2 Player VS, both players need to choose IIDX
* Actually fixed **Course Mode** (Battle, Marathon & Survival Mode)
  * Fixed/Better **Song List**
  * Displays **_panes** & **StepArtists** and correctly calculate their difficulty color
  * Fixed **LifeMeterBar/LifeMeterTime** *(except for Marathon Mode?)*
  * Re-Added stuff in **Course Mode**
    * **Song Time** & **HAS MODS**
      * Introduced **HAS LUA**
    * **RemainingTime** & **DeltaSeconds**
    * Forced implementation of **NoteSkin** via ApplyGameCommand
    * Forced implementation of **SpeedMods** if GamePlay is in Oni mode
    * Added **LifeBar** for Oni Courses that have lives
* Fixed **Rounds/Songs Display**
* Added back **Rotation** to **Judgments** & **Holds** during Gameplay
* Shows **ProductFamily**

The following has been re-introduced from OpenITG's ITG3Encore Theme:
* **BPM Display** *(Disabled in Battle Mode)*
* **Full Combo Splash Animation**
* **CustomMods** and **ScreenFilter**
* **Encore "Folders"**
* **OptionsList** *(Mostly functional)*


Stuff still needs to get fixed, even if the fixed and re-introduced list/code are quite long/big.
Also: This Theme has been optimized for **Project OutFox**! It might work incorrectly when used in StepMania 5!
