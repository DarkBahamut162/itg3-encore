The following project has been in-officially taken over by me (DarkBahamut162).

It's sources have being displayed down below.

## Warning:
This Theme has been optimized for **Project OutFox** and has some additional *(but optional)* features that only work there!
**ITGmania** might be your second pick since .mp4 background videos work in here without much issue. It might work incorrectly when used anywhere else!

## Information:
To switch from **Normal Encore** to **Final Encore**, go into the theme's metrics.ini and set the **EnableFinalTheme** value inside **[Preferences]** to **true**

I could have actually forked it but I didn't. My reasoning was that it wasn't going to be ITG3 anymore but it was being turned into ITG3Encore (something else while starting off using the same code).

What has been done so far:

* All **cmd()** transformed to **function(self)**
* Removed **D-Pad** Modifier since it breaks other Modifiers (like the new SpeedMod)
* Better and sorted **ScreenPlayerOptions**
* Added **MOD** & **BPM range** within **Name Badges** inside **ScreenPlayerOptions**
* Added **TimingData** and **GrooveRadar** Display to **_panes** in **ScreenSelectMusic**
* Added **Player Avatar** to **_panes** in **ScreenSelectMusic** *(Project OutFox AND WideScreen only)*
* Added **CDTitle** next to **ScreenSelectMusic** banner frame *(WideScreen only)*
* Better **StatsDisplay/ShowStats** going from a range of 1-6 instead of just 3
  * Added option for a fully functional IIDX pacemaker with selectable target meter
    * For 2 Player VS, both players need to choose IIDX
* Actually fixed **Course Mode** (Battle, Marathon & Survival Mode)
  * Fixed/Better **Song List**
  * Displays **_panes** & **StepArtists** and correctly calculate their difficulty color
  * Fixed **LifeMeterBar/LifeMeterTime** *(except for Marathon Mode?)*
  * Added **LifeMeterBattery** for Courses with Lives
    * Looks and functions similar to **Pump It Up Pro 2**
  * Re-Added stuff in **Course Mode**
    * **Song Time** & **HAS MODS**
      * Introduced **HAS LUA**
    * **RemainingTime** & **DeltaSeconds**
    * Forced implementation of **NoteSkin** via ApplyGameCommand
    * Forced implementation of **SpeedMods** if GamePlay is in Oni mode
    * Added **LifeBar** for Oni Courses that have lives
* Fixed **Rounds/Songs Display**
* Added back **Rotation** to **Judgments** & **Holds** during Gameplay
* Shows **ProductFamily**
* Added most **Final Theme** stuff while adding/adjusting a few other things.
* Tried to readd **marvelous/perfect/great color bar** on top of the **LifeGraph** in **ScreenEvaluation**
* Added ability to switch between **Normal Score**, **Percentage** and **EX Score** via **Player Options**

The following has been re-introduced from **OpenITG's ITG3Encore Theme**:
* **BPM Display** *(Disabled in Battle Mode)*
* **Full Combo Splash Animation**
* **CustomMods** and **ScreenFilter**
* **Encore "Folders"**
* **OptionsList** *(Mostly functional)*
* **Fitness/Workout Mode** *(1 Player only)*

Stuff still needs to get fixed, even if the fixed and re-introduced list/code are quite long/big.
