I could have actually forked it from the SM5's github but I didn't. My reasoning was that it wasn't ITG3 anymore but it was being turned into ITG3Encore (something else while using the same code).

What has been fixed so far:

* All **cmd()** transformed to **function(self)**
* Removed **D-Pad** Modifier since it breaks other Modifiers (like SM5's new SpeedMod)
* Better and sorted **ScreenPlayerOptions**
* Actually fixed **Course Mode** (Battle, Marathon & Survival Mode)
  * Better **Song List**
  * Display **_panes** & **StepArtists** and correctly calculate their difficulty color
  * Fixed **LifeMeterBar/LifeMeterTime** *(except for Marathon Mode?)*
  * Fixed **Rounds/Songs Display**
* Fixed **PeakComboAward** & **StageAward**

The following has been re-introduced from OpenITG's ITG3Encore Theme:
* Added back rotation to **Judgements** & **Holds** during GamePlay
* **BPM Display** *(Disabled in Battle Mode)*
* **Full Combo Splash Animation**
* **CustomMods** and **ScreenFilter**
* **Encore Folders**

* Re-Added stuff in **Course Mode**
  * **Song Time** & **HAS MODS**
    * Introduced **HAS LUA**
  * **RemainingTime** & **DeltaSeconds**
  * Forced implementation of **NoteSkin** via ApplyGameCommand

Stuff still needs to get fixed, even if the fixed and re-introduced list are quite long.
